<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eddy Current Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Tester</li><li>Non-contact Tester</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Eddy Current Tester is a non-destructive testing technique widely used in various industries. It is primarily categorized into contact and non-contact testers. Contact testers use a probe that comes into direct contact with the material being tested, typically used for surfaces and near-surface flaws. Non-contact testers, on the other hand, use a coil or sensor in proximity to the material, making them suitable for inspecting conductive materials at high speeds or hard-to-reach areas. Both types cater to different testing requirements and provide reliable and efficient flaw detection capabilities.</p></p>
