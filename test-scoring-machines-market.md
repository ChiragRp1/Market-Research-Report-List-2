<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Test Scoring Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Side Reading Type</li><li>Dual Side Reading Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Test scoring machines are devices used to automatically assess and score multiple-choice tests. There are two main types: single-side reading and dual-side reading machines. Single-side reading machines can only read and score one side of a test sheet, while dual-side reading machines can read and score both sides simultaneously. Single-side reading machines are often more affordable and suitable for smaller-scale testing, while dual-side reading machines are more efficient for larger-scale assessments. Both types help streamline the grading process and provide accurate and speedy test results.</p></p>
