<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asthma Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Quick-relief Medications (Rescue Medications)</li><li>Medications for Allergy-induced Asthma</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Asthma drugs can be categorized into two main types, quick-relief medications (also known as rescue medications) and medications for allergy-induced asthma. Quick-relief medications are used to provide immediate relief during asthma attacks or symptoms flare-ups. These medications work by relaxing the airway muscles and opening up the airways, allowing for easier breathing. On the other hand, medications for allergy-induced asthma target the underlying allergic response that triggers asthma symptoms. These drugs aim to reduce inflammation and minimize the body's hypersensitivity to certain allergens, helping to prevent asthma symptoms from occurring.</p></p>
