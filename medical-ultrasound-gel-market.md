<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Ultrasound Gel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sterile</li><li>Non-Sterile</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Medical ultrasound gel is a crucial component in ultrasound procedures, acting as a medium between the probe and the patient's skin. The market for ultrasound gel can be categorized into two types: sterile and non-sterile. Sterile ultrasound gel undergoes a sterilization process, ensuring it is free from any microorganisms, making it suitable for sensitive or invasive procedures and reducing the risk of contamination. On the other hand, non-sterile ultrasound gel is not subjected to sterilization and is commonly used in non-invasive procedures. Both types serve the purpose of enhancing ultrasound imaging quality and facilitating effective diagnosis.</p></p>
