<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CT Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spiral Scan CT</li><li>Single-Slice Spiral Scan CT</li><li>Multi-Slice Spiral Scan CT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CT machine market can be categorized into three types: non-spiral scan CT, single-slice spiral scan CT, and multi-slice spiral scan CT. Non-spiral scan CT refers to the traditional CT technology that captures images slice by slice, resulting in slower scan times. Single-slice spiral scan CT, on the other hand, uses a helical or spiral scanning technique to capture images continuously, reducing scan times. Lastly, multi-slice spiral scan CT combines multiple arrays of detectors to capture multiple images simultaneously, enabling even faster scan times and higher resolution.</p></p>
