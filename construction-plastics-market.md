<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The construction plastics market consists of two main types: thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics. Thermoplastics are polymers that can be melted and re-melted multiple times without undergoing any chemical change. They are commonly used in applications where flexibility and recyclability are important. On the other hand, thermosetting plastics are polymers that undergo irreversible chemical changes when heated, resulting in a hardened state. These plastics offer superior heat resistance and dimensional stability, making them suitable for construction applications that require durability and resistance to high temperatures.</p></p>
