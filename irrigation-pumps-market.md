<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Irrigation Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Non-submersible</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Irrigation pumps are classified into two main types: submersible and non-submersible. Submersible pumps are designed to operate underwater and are usually placed directly into a water source. They are commonly used in wells, boreholes, and reservoirs. Non-submersible pumps, on the other hand, are installed above the water level and draw water from the source using suction or pressure. They are commonly used in irrigation systems, dewatering applications, and agricultural fields. Both types of pumps play a crucial role in enabling efficient water management for irrigation purposes.</p></p>
