<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICD</li><li>CRT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices are medical devices used to treat heart failure by improving the coordination of electrical signals in the heart. There are three main types of CRT devices: pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), and CRT pacemakers (CRT-P). Pacemakers send electrical impulses to regulate heart rhythm, while ICDs can deliver electrical shocks to correct abnormal heart rhythms and also serve as pacemakers. CRT-P devices combine the functions of both pacemakers and CRT devices to synchronize the contractions of the heart's chambers, helping to improve overall heart function and reduce symptoms of heart failure.</p></p>
