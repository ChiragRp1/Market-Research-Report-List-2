<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumped Hydro Storage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-loop System</li><li>Open-loop System</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pumped Hydro Storage market comprises different types such as closed-loop systems, open-loop systems, and other markets. Closed-loop systems involve two interconnected reservoirs at different heights, where water is pumped from lower to higher reservoir during periods of excess electricity, and released back to generate power during peak demand. Open-loop systems are similar, but use natural bodies of water instead of reservoirs to store and release water. Other markets in the Pumped Hydro Storage sector include projects that repurpose existing infrastructure like mines for storage, or use underground reservoirs for water storage. These systems play a crucial role in balancing the grid and storing excess renewable energy.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Pumped Hydro Storage Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Reservoirs</li><li>Man-made Reservoirs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pumped hydro storage is a method of storing energy by using water reservoirs. Natural reservoirs refer to existing bodies of water, such as rivers or lakes, that can be utilized for this purpose. Man-made reservoirs, on the other hand, are artificially created water storage facilities, often constructed by building dams. Both types of reservoirs serve as crucial components in the pumped hydro storage market, allowing excess energy to be stored when demand is low and released when it is high, thus balancing the power grid.</p></p>
