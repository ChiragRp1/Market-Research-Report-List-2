<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Puncture-Proof Tire System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The puncture-proof tire system market includes two main types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires are constructed with overlapping plies of fabric, offering a strong and sturdy structure. They are more durable and resistant to punctures but tend to provide a rougher ride. On the other hand, radial tires have plies that run radially from bead to bead, offering a more flexible and smooth ride. They provide better fuel efficiency, longer lifespan, and improved traction but may be more susceptible to punctures.</p></p>
