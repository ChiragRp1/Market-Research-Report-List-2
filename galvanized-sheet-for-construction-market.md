<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Sheet for Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electro Galvanized Sheet</li><li>Hot Dip Galvanized Sheet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized sheets are commonly used in construction due to their corrosion resistance and durability. Electro galvanized sheets are created by immersing steel in an electrolyte solution and applying an electric current, resulting in a thin layer of zinc coating. This process is suitable for indoor applications where the sheets will not be exposed to harsh environments. On the other hand, hot dip galvanized sheets are coated by dipping steel into a molten zinc bath, creating a thicker and more durable layer of zinc coating. These sheets are ideal for outdoor construction, as they can withstand harsh weather conditions.</p></p>
