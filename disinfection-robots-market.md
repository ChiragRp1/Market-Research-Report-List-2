<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disinfection Robots Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV-C</li><li>HPV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disinfection robots are advanced technological devices used for sterilizing and cleaning various environments. Two common types of disinfection robots are UV-C and HPV robots. UV-C robots use ultraviolet-C light to kill and deactivate microorganisms like bacteria and viruses. They emit short-wavelength UV light that penetrates the genetic material of these pathogens, disrupting their DNA and rendering them inactive. On the other hand, HPV robots use hydrogen peroxide vapor to eliminate pathogens. The vapor is dispersed into the environment, where it reacts with microorganisms, breaking down their structures and eliminating the threat of contamination.</p></p>
