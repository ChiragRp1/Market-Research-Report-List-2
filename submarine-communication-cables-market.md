<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Communication Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unarmoured Submarine Communication Cables</li><li>Armoured Submarine Communication Cables</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Submarine Communication Cables market consists of two main types: Unarmoured Submarine Communication Cables and Armoured Submarine Communication Cables. Unarmoured cables are designed without any external protective layers, making them vulnerable to damage from external factors such as underwater currents or accidental impacts. On the other hand, Armoured cables are reinforced with additional protective layers, such as steel wires or armor, providing enhanced resistance against external threats. These cables are used for transmitting data over long distances underwater, connecting continents and enabling global communication networks.</p></p>
