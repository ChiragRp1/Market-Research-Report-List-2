<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled infrared detectors</li><li>Uncooled infrared detectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the infrared camera market, there are two main types of infrared detectors: cooled and uncooled. Cooled infrared detectors utilize a cooling mechanism such as a cryogenic cooler to reduce the temperature of the detector, resulting in higher sensitivity and lower noise levels. These detectors are often used in applications that require high image resolution and accuracy. On the other hand, uncooled infrared detectors do not require cooling mechanisms and operate at ambient temperatures. They are typically smaller and less expensive, making them suitable for a wider range of applications where cost and portability are important factors.</p></p>
