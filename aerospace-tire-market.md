<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aerospace tire market consists of two main types: radial tire and bias tire. Radial tires are designed with cords that run across the tire from bead to bead, providing greater flexibility and reducing heat buildup. They offer improved stability, fuel efficiency, and longer tread life. Conversely, bias tires have overlapping cross-ply construction, with multiple rubber layers crisscrossing at angles from bead to bead. These tires are cheaper to produce and maintain, making them suitable for certain applications that do not require high performance or durability.</p></p>
