<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tablet Metal Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balanced Coil Systems</li><li>Ferrous-in-Foil Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tablet Metal Detector market consists of two main types: Balanced Coil Systems and Ferrous-in-Foil Systems. Balanced Coil Systems use two coils to create a balanced electromagnetic field. When a metal object is detected, the balance is disrupted, triggering an alert. These systems are reliable for detecting most types of metal contaminants. Ferrous-in-Foil Systems, on the other hand, are specifically designed to detect ferrous metals hidden within aluminum foil packaging. These systems use advanced technology to differentiate between ferrous and non-ferrous metals, ensuring accurate detection in various packaging materials.</p></p>
