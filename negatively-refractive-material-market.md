<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Negatively Refractive Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>1(Refractive Index)</li><li>2(Refractive Index)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The negatively refractive material market is divided into two types based on refractive index. Type-1 market comprises materials with a refractive index less than zero, which means they exhibit unusual optical properties like bending light in the opposite direction. These materials find applications in advanced imaging systems and anti-gravity technologies. Type-2 market consists of materials with refractive index below unity, resulting in a reduction in the speed of light passing through them. These materials are used in the development of superlenses and photonic devices for manipulating light at the nanoscale.</p></p>
