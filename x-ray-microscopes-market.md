<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-Ray Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission X-Ray Microscope</li><li>Scanning X-Ray Microscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>X-ray microscopes are imaging devices that use X-rays to analyze a sample. Transmission X-ray microscopes (TXM) are equipped with a high-resolution lens that can magnify the image produced by X-rays passing through a sample. This type of microscope is suitable for studying internal structures of objects. On the other hand, scanning X-ray microscopes (SXM) use a focused beam of X-rays to create images by scanning across the surface of the sample. SXM is commonly used for analyzing the surface details of a sample without damaging it.</p></p>
