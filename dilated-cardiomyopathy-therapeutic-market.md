<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dilated Cardiomyopathy Therapeutic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aldosterone antagonists</li><li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</li><li>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)</li><li>Beta-blockers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dilated cardiomyopathy therapeutic market includes various types of medications that are used to treat this condition. Aldosterone antagonists are drugs that inhibit the action of aldosterone hormone, helping to reduce fluid retention and lower blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower blood pressure by blocking the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) also reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of angiotensin II on blood vessels. Beta-blockers work by blocking the effects of adrenaline, reducing heart rate and blood pressure. These medications are commonly prescribed to manage symptoms and improve outcomes in dilated cardiomyopathy patients.</p></p>
