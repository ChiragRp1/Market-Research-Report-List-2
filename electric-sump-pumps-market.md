<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Sump Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible Pumps</li><li>Pedestal Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric sump pumps market consists of two main types: submersible pumps and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps are designed to be fully submerged in water and are highly efficient in pumping out large volumes of water. They are often placed directly in the sump pit. On the other hand, pedestal pumps are equipped with a motor on top of the pump and are positioned above the water level. They are generally less expensive but less efficient compared to submersible pumps.</p></p>
