<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-static Packaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrostatic Shielding Type</li><li>Static Conductive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static packaging market consists of two main types: electrostatic shielding and static conductive. Electrostatic shielding packaging provides a barrier that protects electronic components from external static charges by diverting the charge safely away from the package contents. On the other hand, static conductive packaging allows the dissipation of static charges generated within the package to prevent damage to sensitive electronics. Both types of packaging play a crucial role in ensuring the safe transportation and storage of electronic products, minimizing the risk of damage caused by static electricity.</p></p>
