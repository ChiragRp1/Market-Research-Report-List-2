<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endoscope Reprocessors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber</li><li>Multi Chamber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Endoscope reprocessors are medical devices used to clean, disinfect, and sterilize endoscopes after use. They come in two types: single chamber and multi-chamber. Single chamber reprocessors have one chamber where the endoscope is cleaned and then reprocessed in the same cycle. On the other hand, multi-chamber reprocessors consist of separate chambers for each step of the reprocessing cycle, such as cleaning, rinsing, and sterilization. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining endoscope hygiene, reducing the risk of infections, and ensuring patient safety.</p></p>
