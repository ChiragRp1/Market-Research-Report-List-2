<p><ul><li>Direct Gas Supplement</li><li>Indirect Gas Supplement</li><li>Non-gas Supplement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Make-up air units are devices that supply fresh air to indoor spaces to replace the air that is exhausted. There are three types of make-up air units based on the fuel used: direct gas supplement, indirect gas supplement, and non-gas supplement. Direct gas supplement units use natural gas or propane to directly heat the incoming air. Indirect gas supplement units utilize a heat exchanger to separate the combustion process from the supply air. Non-gas supplement units do not use combustion, instead relying on electric heat or other non-gas heating methods to warm the fresh air.</p></p>
