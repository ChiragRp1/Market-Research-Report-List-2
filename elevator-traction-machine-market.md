<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elevator Traction Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Geared Machine</li><li>Gearless Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The elevator traction machine market can be categorized into two types: geared machines and gearless machines. Geared machines utilize a gearbox to control the speed and torque of the elevator, making them suitable for low and medium-rise buildings. On the other hand, gearless machines directly connect the elevator cab to the motor without the need for a gearbox, enabling higher speeds and smoother rides, making them ideal for tall and high-rise structures. Both types have their advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the building.</p></p>
