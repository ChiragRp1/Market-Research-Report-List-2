<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Engine Water Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Water Pump</li><li>Electric Water Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive engine water pump market comprises two main types: mechanical water pumps and electric water pumps. Mechanical water pumps, driven by the engine's crankshaft via a belt or pulley system, circulate coolant throughout the engine, preventing overheating. On the other hand, electric water pumps operate independently, driven by an electric motor, and provide better control over coolant flow. Both types aim to maintain the engine's optimal temperature range to ensure efficient performance and prevent any damage caused by excessive heat.</p></p>
